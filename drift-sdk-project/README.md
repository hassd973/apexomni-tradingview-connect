# Drift SDK Project

This folder contains a minimal example that demonstrates how to use the
[Drift Protocol](https://github.com/drift-labs/protocol-v2) SDK. It assumes the
SDK is available on npm as `@drift-labs/sdk`.

## Setup

```bash
cd drift-sdk-project
npm install
```

## Usage

Run the example script:

```bash
npm start
```

The example initializes a `DriftClient`. Extend `index.js` with your own logic
(for example fetching markets or placing orders).
